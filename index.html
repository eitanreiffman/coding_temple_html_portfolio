            <h3>Hey there! My name is Eitan Reiffman, and I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. 
                I've moved around a lot throughout my life, but I currently live in New York. 
                I love hanging out with my family, playing basketball, trying out new cuisines, traveling, 
                and rewatching Lord of the Rings for the 111th time. 
                I've worked as a writer, editor, campaign manager, and copywriter. 
                I'm also a musician, singer-songwriter, and producer. 
                I love all creative art forms, which is one of the many factors that led me to software programming.

            <h1>Becoming a Programmer</h1>
            <h3>If you told me a year ago that one year later I'd be studying to be a software developer, 
                I would've found that pretty shocking. But I guess it was always in the back of my mind, 
                and perhaps I just needed the right life circumstance to give me that push. I don't believe in 
                worthwhile results without the proper dedication and hard work. That being said, I think 
                hard work can also be something enjoyable with the right attitude.

            <h1>Music</h1>
            <h3>Music is a big part of my life. Below are a few artwork covers of some of my past 
                releases which you can check out <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3t6MS9zgpZXWhjhF5bXxoe" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                While a new career focus means less time to focus on music, I'm super excited about the prospect of 
                learning a new skillset. In addition, I believe there are ways to integrate musical concepts with software programming ideas.

            <h3>If traveling is just another trend, then call me a sheep. When life circumstances allow for it, 
                I love seeing what the world has to offer. I especially enjoy different kinds of 
                architecture, and natural beauty such as mountains ranges, forests, and lakes. A few places I've been 
                to include Switzerland, Vienna, and Thailand.
